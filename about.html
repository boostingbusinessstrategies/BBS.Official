            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>What types of databases do you offer?</h3>
                <p>We provide customized databases tailored for various sectors, including E-commerce and Healthcare, among others. Our databases are built on MySQL, offering greater versatility and ease of integration with websites, AWS, and Oracle.</p>

                <h3>How long does it take to develop a database?</h3>
                <p>Our standard delivery time is 2 days, depending on the complexity and requirements of the project.</p>

                <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
                <p>We primarily accept payments via PayPal. You can pay with your card through PayPal by having an account. Payments will be directed to the account of our founder, Aaron Obando. Ensure your payment is processed before we begin development.</p>

                <h3>Can I request changes to the database after it's delivered?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we offer a revision service for adjustments based on your feedback within a limited timeframe after delivery. You have up to 3 opportunities for free changes during the 7-day guarantee period. We recommend testing the database during these days to ensure it meets your needs. Changes requested within this period will not incur any charges. However, modifications such as adding new columns or tables will incur a fee if requested after the 7-day guarantee period. You can request these changes at any time, even outside the guarantee period, but additional charges will apply.</p>

                <h3>What if I need to edit an existing MySQL database?</h3>
                <p>For editing a MySQL database that was not created by us, there is a fee of $149.</p>

                <h3>Is my data safe with you?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! We adhere to GDPR and CCPA regulations, ensuring your data is secure and confidential. We will only use your name, surname, and email to communicate with you during the service. Once you are satisfied with our service, we will ask for your feedback and whether you would like to receive email updates about our services, such as future developments in NoSQL databases, AWS, campaigns, and more. If you choose not to receive updates, your email, name, and surname will be removed from our records, ensuring your privacy. We are committed to maintaining the security of your data and preserving your privacy, so we will never ask for any additional data or store it without your consent. The email will only be used for communication until the project is completed and you confirm your satisfaction with our services.</p>

                <h3>Do you offer support for database edits?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can request support for database edits. However, please note that we do not currently provide data entry or queries.</p>

                <h3>Can I request a SQLite database?</h3>
                <p>You can request SQLite databases if desired; however, keep in mind that they do not offer as much versatility as MySQL and lack a server.</p>
