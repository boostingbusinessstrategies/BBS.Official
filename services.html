                <h3>Do you support editing existing MySQL databases?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we can edit existing MySQL databases, even those not originally developed by us. The cost for modification depends on the complexity and data volume of the database. Service fees range from $119 to $1,999. For more detailed information, please refer to our terms and conditions. This allows us to tailor your existing database to better meet your evolving business needs.</p>
