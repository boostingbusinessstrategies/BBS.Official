                <h3>What payment methods are accepted?</h3>
                <p>We accept payments via PayPal and credit/debit cards through PayPal.

                <h3>Do you support editing existing MySQL databases?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we can edit existing MySQL databases, even those not originally developed by us. The cost for modification depends on the complexity and data volume of the database. Service fees range from $119 to $1,999. For more detailed information, please refer to our terms and conditions.

                <p>If you require additional modifications after the guarantee period, we are happy to assist for a reasonable fee.
