            <h2>Commitment to Our Customers</h2>
            <p>At BBS, we are dedicated to providing tailored database solutions for the E-commerce, healthcare, and other key industries. Our focus is on delivering high-quality, customized solutions that meet your specific business needs, ensuring satisfaction and data protection.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="security-privacy" class="container">
            <h2>Security and Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We take data security very seriously. BBS strictly adheres to GDPR and CCPA regulations, ensuring all customer data is handled with confidentiality. We only collect essential information (email, name, surname) to facilitate communication and project execution. With customer consent, we may retain this data for future updates or promotions; otherwise, it is securely deleted upon project completion.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="refund-return" class="container">
            <h2>Refund and Return Policy</h2>
            <p>We offer a 7-day satisfaction guarantee for all database projects. During this period, clients can request up to three free modifications to ensure the delivered solution meets their expectations. If, after these adjustments, and within 7 days, you are not satisfied, we will refund 100% of the paid amount. No refunds or returns will be processed after the 7-day period. Any change requests after this period will incur additional costs. Clients acknowledge and accept these terms at the time of purchase.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="service-guarantee" class="container">
            <h2>Service Guarantee</h2>
            <p>All BBS services include a 7-day quality guarantee, offering three free modifications during this time to ensure customer satisfaction. After the 7 days, any further modifications will be charged according to the current rates.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="shipping-policies" class="container">
            <h2>Shipping Policies</h2>
            <p>The delivery of services will be conducted via email. However, customers have the right to request delivery through Messenger or WhatsApp for their convenience. The delivery will be completed within a maximum of 5 business days. If you do not receive any response from us within 48 hours, it may be due to high demand. You can contact us to inquire about the status of your order and see if we can expedite the process. Please note that the database will be sent in a compressed ZIP format; however, customers can request it in an uncompressed format according to their needs. The database will not be sent encrypted; this must be done by the owner or responsible engineer to facilitate its rapid shipping and installation. If you have not received your order and wish to request a refund, you can do so through our communication channels; however, a recovery penalty of 15% of the paid amount will be applied, which is acknowledged and accepted by the customer upon purchase.</p>

    <section id="database-content-policies" class="container">
        <h2>Database Content Policies</h2>
    
        <h3>1. Prohibited Information</h3>
        <p>Requests for columns containing sensitive information such as emails, phone numbers, passport IDs, or other personal sensitive information are not allowed, in compliance with CCPA and GDPR regulations. We only request names and surnames as maximum information.</p>
    
        <h3>2. Optimization</h3>
        <p>All databases include indexes to ensure optimal performance and are delivered ready for immediate use. No temporary tables or CTEs will be created; this must be handled by the owner or engineer post-purchase. Modifications involving these elements will void the database warranty.</p>
    
        <h3>3. Modifications</h3>
        <p>Up to three free modifications can be requested within a 7-day guarantee period. Additional modifications or requests outside this period will incur extra charges.</p>
    
        <h3>4. Delivery and Guarantee</h3>
        <p>Customized databases will be delivered within a maximum of 5 business days. If you are not satisfied with the result, we offer a money-back guarantee.</p>
    
        <h3>5. Payment</h3>
        <p>Payment must be made before the development process begins. Payments are handled through PayPal, and pricing varies according to the selected plan. If the full payment for the selected plan is not received, either due to accident or error, we will contact you to confirm whether you prefer a refund for the amount paid or wish to complete the remaining payment to proceed with the project. If you wish for a refund due to an incomplete payment, the 15% penalty will not apply, as it was an erroneous charge. Additionally, in the case of payments made in excess of the cost, the remaining amount will be refunded, and if the payment is less than the cost, we will contact you as mentioned earlier.</p>
