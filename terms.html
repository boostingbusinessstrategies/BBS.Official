Our commitment is rooted in understanding the unique needs of your business, enabling us to provide personalized solutions that enhance your operational efficiency and drive your success.

        <section id="security-privacy" class="container">
            <h2>Security and Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Safeguarding your data is our top priority, and we implement rigorous protocols to ensure its protection. We fully comply with internationally recognized data protection regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), ensuring that all customer data is processed with the utmost confidentiality and security. We collect only the essential information required to facilitate effective communication and execute projects efficiently, specifically limited to your email, name, and surname. In the event that you provide explicit consent, we may securely retain this information for the purpose of providing future updates or promotional offers. However, if consent is not granted, we are committed to securely erasing all customer data upon project completion, maintaining our strict privacy standards and upholding your rights to confidentiality at all times.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="refund-return" class="container">
            <h2>Refund and Return Policy</h2>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring complete client satisfaction, which is why we offer a 7-day satisfaction guarantee on all our database projects. During this period, clients are entitled to request up to three revisions or modifications to ensure that the final product aligns with their expectations and specific business needs. Should the client remain unsatisfied after these revisions, and if it falls within the 7-day window, we will issue a full refund of the paid amount without hesitation. However, once this 7-day period has elapsed, no refunds or returns will be permitted under any circumstances. Additionally, any modification requests submitted after this timeframe will be subject to our standard service rates and will incur additional charges. By proceeding with a purchase, the client fully acknowledges and agrees to these terms, ensuring mutual understanding and clarity from the outset.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="service-guarantee" class="container">
            <h2>Service Guarantee</h2>
            <p>We are fully committed to delivering services that meet the highest standards of quality and customer satisfaction. To reinforce this commitment, all of our services are backed by a comprehensive 7-day quality guarantee. During this period, clients may request up to three modifications at no additional cost, ensuring that the final deliverable aligns perfectly with their expectations and business objectives. Should any further modifications be required after the 7-day window has closed, they will be subject to additional fees based on our current pricing structure. This policy reflects our unwavering dedication to providing exceptional service and ensuring that every project we deliver meets the specific needs and standards of our clients.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="shipping-policies" class="container">
            <h2>Shipping Policies</h2>
            <p>All services are delivered electronically, with email being the primary method of delivery. However, for added convenience, clients may also request delivery through alternative channels such as Messenger or WhatsApp. The delivery of all services is guaranteed within a maximum timeframe of 5 business days. If a response has not been received within 48 hours, it is possible that this is due to high demand. In such cases, clients are encouraged to contact us directly to inquire about the status of their order and explore options for expedited processing, if necessary. The databases will be provided in a compressed ZIP format, but clients may request alternative, uncompressed formats based on their specific needs. Please note that encryption of the database is not included as part of the delivery process; it is the responsibility of the client’s designated engineer to manage encryption and ensure smooth installation. In the event that a refund is requested for undelivered services, a 15% recovery fee will be applied, and this condition is accepted upon the confirmation of purchase.</p>
        </section>

    <section id="database-content-policies" class="container">
        <h2>Database Content Policies</h2>
    
        <h3>1. Prohibited Information</h3>
        <p>Requests for database columns containing sensitive personal information are strictly prohibited to ensure full compliance with privacy regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and other relevant legal frameworks. This includes, but is not limited to, the collection or inclusion of data such as emails, phone numbers, passport numbers, or other personal identification details. The only permissible personal information allowed in a database, in the absence of legal certification, is the client's name and surname. Any request for more extensive personal data must be accompanied by the appropriate legal documentation and certification that authorizes its use, ensuring that all data handling adheres to the highest standards of privacy and legal responsibility.</p>
        <p>
            It is prohibited to request the following data: <br>
            Location <br>
            Email <br>
            Phone number <br>
            Social media handles <br>
            Postal code <br>
            Bank account numbers <br>
            Credit card digits <br>
            National ID numbers <br>
            Passport numbers <br>
            Medical records <br>
            Personal information of minors <br>
            Any other sensitive, traceable, or financial data.
        </p>
        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <p>The only exceptions to this policy arise when the client possesses valid legal certification, such as GDPR compliance or CCPA certification, that explicitly authorizes the use of sensitive personal data. In such instances, it is imperative that the client ensures their users are fully informed and have granted consent for the utilization of their sensitive information. This requirement is especially critical for industries such as private clinics, e-commerce, and any businesses that manage financial or identifiable data. To facilitate this process, the client must provide an official certificate or a photocopy of the relevant legal documentation in PDF format. This documentation must be submitted as either a photo or PDF document for verification purposes. It is important to note that we do not retain this documentation within our systems; it is utilized solely for the purpose of confirming its legitimacy. This requirement is integral to upholding our legal and ethical integrity while ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
        
        <h3>Liability Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>BBS explicitly disclaims any legal responsibility for issues that may arise from the improper use or insufficient protection of your database. This includes, but is not limited to, situations involving data breaches, hacking incidents, or violations of data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). While our team is committed to providing robust solutions designed to help your business maintain security and compliance with these pertinent regulations, it is essential to understand that the ultimate responsibility for the protection and management of the database rests with the client. This responsibility encompasses all aspects of data handling, including ensuring appropriate security measures, adherence to legal requirements, and the implementation of best practices for data privacy and protection.</p>
    
        <h3>2. Optimization</h3>
        <p>All databases delivered include indexed fields designed to ensure optimal performance and are structured for immediate use upon delivery. This built-in indexing facilitates efficient data retrieval and enhances overall database functionality, allowing clients to seamlessly integrate the solution into their existing systems. However, it is important to note that we do not create temporary tables or common table expressions (CTEs) as part of our service; clients or their designated engineers are responsible for managing these elements following the purchase. Should these components be added after delivery, specifically within the 7 days following receipt of the database, it will result in the nullification of the warranty associated with the database. This policy underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity and intended functionality of the database as delivered, while ensuring that clients understand their responsibilities regarding any modifications made post-delivery.</p>
    
        <h3>3. Modifications</h3>
        <p>Clients are entitled to request up to three complimentary modifications within the 7-day guarantee period, allowing them to fine-tune the database according to their specific needs and preferences. This provision ensures that the final product aligns closely with their operational requirements and expectations. However, it is essential to note that any modification requests submitted after this guarantee period, or requests that exceed the initial three complimentary modifications, will be subject to additional charges. The cost of these extra modifications will be determined based on the complexity and scope of the changes requested. This policy is designed to maintain transparency in our pricing structure while providing clients the flexibility to enhance their database solutions as needed.</p>
    
        <h3>4. Delivery and Guarantee</h3>
        <p>Customized databases are delivered within a maximum timeframe of 5 business days, ensuring that clients receive their solutions promptly and can begin implementation without unnecessary delays. In the event that a client is not satisfied with the result, we offer a money-back guarantee, provided that the dissatisfaction is communicated within 7 days of receiving the database. It is important to note that any manipulation of the database that damages its optimization or alters its structure during the guarantee period will automatically void the guarantee. We cannot be held responsible for how the database is utilized or any modifications made by the client after it has been delivered. Once the database is in the client's possession, the responsibility for its use and any resulting implications rests solely with the client, including how it is adapted to meet their specific objectives.</p>
    
        <h3>5. Payment</h3>
        <p>Payments must be completed prior to the commencement of the database development process, ensuring that all financial arrangements are settled before any work begins. All transactions are securely processed through PayPal, and pricing structures are determined based on the selected service plan. In the event of an incomplete or accidental payment, we will proactively reach out to the client to confirm their preference—either to process a refund or to finalize the outstanding payment. If a refund is requested due to an incomplete payment, the 15% penalty typically associated with refunds will not apply, recognizing that the charge was unintentional. Furthermore, in instances of overpayment, the excess amount will be promptly refunded to the client. It is important to note that this payment policy applies to all of our services, ensuring consistency and clarity across our offerings while maintaining transparency in our financial processes.</p>

        <h3>2. Call Restrictions</h3>
        <p>We do not accept phone calls, video calls, or voice messages as part of our communication policy. Any attempts to reach us through these channels will not receive a response. This policy is in place to ensure that all communications are handled efficiently and documented properly, allowing for better tracking and resolution of client inquiries.

    <section id="database-extension-policies" class="container">
        <h2>Database Extension Policies by Plan</h2>
        <p>Each plan includes a 3-day guarantee, allowing clients up to two free modifications or adjustments within this period. As previously mentioned, this guarantee may be nullified if the client independently modifies the database after it has been extended and delivered. This policy specifically applies to databases created by our company. In cases where the client wishes to modify an existing database, the applicable fees may differ. Therefore, it is necessary for clients to contact us first to discuss the specific requirements and any associated costs.</p>
    
        <h3>1. Basic Plan</h3>
        <p>Clients on the Basic Plan can request up to 4 additional tables or 8 additional columns per order. If more modifications are needed beyond this scope, a new request can be submitted within 24 hours of the initial changes. This structured approach ensures that clients receive the necessary enhancements while maintaining clarity in the modification process.</p>
    
        <h3>2. Standard Plan</h3>
        <p>The Standard Plan includes the option for clients to request up to 4 additional tables or a total of 20 additional columns per order. As with the Basic Plan, further modifications can be requested within 24 hours of the initial adjustments. This flexibility allows clients to make necessary changes promptly and efficiently.</p>
    
        <h3>3. Business Plan</h3>
        <p>The Business Plan offers unlimited changes, ensuring that all client needs are met without restriction. This comprehensive coverage allows clients to adapt their databases to evolving business requirements seamlessly. The commitment to unlimited modifications reflects our dedication to providing exceptional service and support to our Business Plan clients.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="existing-database-modifications" class="container">
        <h2>Policies for Existing Database Modifications</h2>
    
        <h3>1. Guarantee</h3>
        <p>Modifications to existing databases are covered by a 10-day guarantee, during which clients can request additional changes free of charge. It is crucial to understand that this guarantee may be voided if the client independently alters the database once it has been delivered. Clients must agree to our terms and conditions before initiating any modifications, as this ensures mutual understanding and accountability throughout the process.</p>
    
        <h3>2. Recommendation</h3>
        <p>We strongly recommend that clients maintain a backup of their database prior to requesting any changes. Modifying a previously used database without careful consideration and a well-planned approach may lead to unforeseen issues. While we will not add anything that the client has not specifically requested, it is essential to acknowledge that unauthorized modifications may impact the database's functionality and optimal usage. Our team is available to provide guidance and suggest potential adjustments that align with the client's needs while safeguarding the original data structure and design. However, the client assumes full responsibility for any complications that may arise from changes made to the database. We are committed to delivering professional work and will address any inquiries, suggestions, and requests. We will also provide recommendations to ensure that the changes do not disrupt the hierarchical schema or hinder data manipulation and analysis.</p>
    
        <h3>3. Accepted Formats</h3>
        <p>We only modify MySQL and SQLite databases. All files must be submitted in their original export format, compressed into a ZIP file. We do not require direct access to the client's database server for modifications, streamlining the process for both parties. It is advisable to send the database in an unencrypted ZIP format to facilitate modifications according to the client's specifications.</p>
    
        <h3>4. Client Responsibility</h3>
        <p>It is the client’s responsibility to ensure compliance with legal requirements when it comes to sensitive data. Adding sensitive information to the database is strictly prohibited unless the client possesses valid certification or permission verifying their legal right to use such data. This certification must demonstrate that the client has obtained the necessary consent from users regarding the use of their sensitive information.</p>
    
        <h3>5. Liability Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>Neither our company nor Aaron Obando, the founder, will be held liable for any oversight or data loss resulting from modifications, the failure to conduct backups, security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches, or any cyberattacks that may occur during or after the modification process. Clients must prioritize data protection and implement adequate security measures to safeguard their information.</p>
    
        <h3>6. Modification Fees</h3>
        <p>The cost for modifications is structured based on the complexity and size of the database. For databases with 5 to 8 tables or approximately 5,000 records, the fee is $149. For those with 8 to 12 tables or around 25,000 records, the charge increases to $849. For databases exceeding 12 tables and classified as intensive or enterprise use (with more than 60,000 records), the fee is set at $1,999. These prices reflect the intricacies of the work and the risks involved. Clients acknowledge and accept these terms upon proceeding with modifications.</p>
    
        <h3>7. Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
        <p>This service incurs a 15% penalty for refunds, applicable both for cancellations prior to the initiation of work and for completed work. This measure is instituted to ensure the integrity of our business. In the event of a refund request, clients will receive a backup copy made by us, along with the modified version that proved most functional for their needs.</p>
    
        <h3>8. Commitment to Client Satisfaction</h3>
        <p>Our dedication is to maintain client satisfaction and the optimal functioning of their databases. Clients need not worry about losing their work, as we will perform regular backups, including any changes made that the client approves. The special guarantee for this service allows for up to 10 changes within the 10-day window. However, this guarantee will be voided if the client alters the database after delivery. Therefore, we encourage clients to thoroughly read and understand these policies before proceeding with any modifications.</p>
    
        <h3>9. Modification of New or Unused Databases from Other Providers</h3>
        <p>If the database being modified is an existing one that was acquired from another provider or developer and has not been used prior or contains between 0 to 2000 records, the modification fee will be set at $119. This applies only to databases from other providers or developers. In the case of our databases, the extension fee must be paid separately, as previously mentioned. This modification will still be subject to the guarantee provided under this policy, allowing for a maximum of 5 changes within the specified timeframe. As previously indicated, the guarantee may be voided if the client modifies the database independently during the guarantee period. Additionally, a refund penalty of 10% will apply in this case. Clients are encouraged to review the terms and conditions applicable to these modifications to ensure compliance and understanding of the process.</p>
